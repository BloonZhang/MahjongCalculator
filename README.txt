This is a basic calculator where you input 14 mahjong tiles, and the app will tell you if your hand is a winning hand or not.

Most of the code I wrote is in MahjongCalculator.cpp, which handles the actual windows application. I also created a class, Storage.hpp, which stores the mahjong tiles and calculates if they form a winning hand.
